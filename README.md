# Highspeed Task

## Description

This repository contains all code to run the behavioral task used in Wittkuhn & Schuck (2020), *bioRxiv*, [doi: 10.1101/2020.02.15.950667](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.15.950667)

![task](/task.png)

The task consists of three conditions:

1. In **slow trials** participants have to press a button in response to upside-down visual stimuli (20% of trials) and do nothing if pictures are presented upright (80% of trials).
1. In **sequence trials** participants have to detect the serial position of a target image in a sequence of five images presented at varying speeds (32, 64, 128, 512, and 2048 ms inter-stimulus intervals) and indicate their response after a delay of 16 s after the onset of the object sequence.
1. In **repetition trials**, participants have to perform the same detection task as in sequence task, except that two out of five visual stimuli are repeated a varying number of times and participant are instructed to indicate the serial position of *the first occurrence* of the second (target) stimulus

Data reported in Wittkuhn & Schuck (2020), *bioRxiv* were acquired using Matlab version R2012b (Natick, Massachusetts, USA; The MathWorks Inc.) and the task was run on a Windows XP computer.

## Requirements

- [Matlab version R2012b or higher (Natick, Massachusetts, USA; The MathWorks Inc.)](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- [Psychophysics Toolbox extensions; version 3.0.11](http://psychtoolbox.org/) - Psychtoolbox is included in this repo as a submodule and the paths are accessed by the task code

### Sounds

There are three different sounds used in this task, placed in the `/sounds` folder.

#### `soundCoin.wav`

The coin sound signals correct responses.
The original sound is the "Coin" sound from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game "Super Mario World" and can be downloaded for free from https://themushroomkingdom.net/media/smw/wav.

#### `soundError.wav`

The error sound signals incorrect and missed responses.
The original sound is the "Yoshi spitting" sound from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game "Super Mario World" and can be downloaded for free from https://themushroomkingdom.net/media/smw/wav.

#### `soundWait.wav`

In the delay period of the sequence and repetition trials (interval between the offset of the last sequence item to 16 s after sequence onset), participants listened to bird sounds to keep them moderately entertained.
